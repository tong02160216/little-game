- Cloud: 1/8 scale + smoothscale for smooth processing
- All game elements maintain unified aesthetics

**UI Pixelation**:
- Button borders: 8√ó8 pixel blocks stitched together
- Text backgrounds: White fill + gray pixel border
- START button: Dark green border decoration

#### Animation System
- **Cloud Floating**: Sinusoidal vertical motion, periodic 15-pixel movement

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technology Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame 2.x**: Game framework
  - `pygame.transform`: Image scaling, pixelation processing
  - `pygame.font`: Font rendering, pixel text
  - `pygame.draw`: Graphics drawing (rectangles, lines)
  - `pygame.mixer`: Audio playback management
  - `pygame.time`: Time control, animation timing

### Tiered Reward Mechanism Implementation

```python
# Score 0: No celebration triggered
if player_x == end_x and player_y == end_y and score > 0:
    celebration_started = True

# Score 1: Basic celebration (cloud+text+sound)
if celebration_started:
    # Play celebration sound
    celebration_sound.play()
    # Draw cloud and Congratulations text

# Score >1: Full celebration (+balloons+cheering)
if celebration_started and score > 1:
    # Create 42 colorful balloons
    for balloon_img in balloon_images:
        for _ in range(7):
            celebration_balloons.append(CelebrationBalloon(balloon_img))
    # Play cheering sound
    applause_sound.play()

# Score ‚â•5: Luxury celebration (+crown+beams)
if celebration_started and score >= 5:
    # Draw crown
    draw_crown(screen, crown_x, crown_y)
    # Draw 16 dynamic beams
    for angle in range(16):
        draw_beam(screen, angle * 22.5, pulse_animation)
```

### Core Algorithms

**1. Maze Generation**:
- Random generation algorithm
- Path validation ensures reachability

**2. Collision Detection**:
- Grid-based position detection
- Food collection detection
- House arrival detection

**3. Pixelation Rendering**:
```python
# Scale down then up to create pixel effect
small_surface = font.render(text, True, color)
pixel_surface = pygame.transform.scale(small_surface, (width * scale, height * scale))
```

**4. Animation Interpolation**:
```python
# Sinusoidal wave animation
offset = math.sin(angle) * amplitude
# Pulse animation
pulse = math.sin(frame * speed + offset) * range + base
```

**5. Color Gradient**:
```python
# Score-based color interpolation
if score >= threshold:
    color = lerp(color1, color2, factor)
```

### Code Structure
- **Main File**: `import pygame.py` (~1218 lines)
- **Main Classes**:
  - `CelebrationBalloon`: Celebration balloon class
- **Main Functions**:
  - `generate_maze()`: Maze generation
  - `draw_maze()`: Maze rendering
  - `draw_crown()`: Crown rendering
- **Game Loops**:
  - Start screen loop
  - Main game loop
